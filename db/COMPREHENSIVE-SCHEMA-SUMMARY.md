## üîç Progressive Recognition Algorithm

The crown jewel of the system is the progressive recognition algorithm that creates a magical user experience:

### Confidence Levels & Actions
- **98-100% Confidence**: Auto-link with pre-filled form
- **85-97% Confidence**: "Looks like you're already in our system - is this you?"
- **70-84% Confidence**: Silent admin queue for review
- **<70% Confidence**: Treat as new user

### Matching Factors
```javascript
const matchingFactors = {
  emailExact: 50,          // john@gmail.com ‚Üí john@gmail.com
  emailSimilar: 30,        // john.smith@gmail.com ‚Üí johnsmith@gmail.com  
  phoneExact: 45,          // Normalized phone number match
  nameExact: 40,           // First + last name exact match
  addressContext: 25,      // Same address strengthens other matches
  familyRelation: 30,      // Same last name + address = family member
  previousActivity: 20,    // Has submitted forms before
  consistentDetails: 15,   // Details consistent across submissions
  
  // Negative factors
  conflictingInfo: -30,    // Email says John, form says Jane
  ageInconsistency: -20,   // Birth date doesn't match previous submissions
  differentChurch: -100    // Profile from different church (security)
};
```

### Privacy Protection
- Email masking: `john.smith@gmail.com` ‚Üí `j***h@gmail.com`
- Phone masking: `(555) 123-4567` ‚Üí `(555) ***-4567`
- No PII exposed without explicit user confirmation

## üèóÔ∏è Performance Architecture

### Multi-Tenant Optimization
Every table includes `church_id` with strategic indexing for tenant isolation:

```sql
-- Critical performance indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_events_church_lookup ON events(church_id, status, start_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_profiles_recognition ON person_profiles(church_id, email, phone) 
  WHERE profile_status != 'merged';
CREATE INDEX idx_submissions_recent ON form_submissions(church_id, submitted_at DESC);
```

### Scalability Targets
- **Churches**: 100+ churches with full isolation
- **Members per Church**: 10,000+ members with sub-50ms queries
- **Concurrent Users**: 1,000+ simultaneous form submissions
- **Data Volume**: 10M+ form submissions with efficient archiving

### Caching Strategy
- **Redis**: Profile recognition results cached for 1 hour
- **Database**: Materialized views for analytics
- **CDN**: Form assets and images globally distributed

## üîê Security & Privacy

### Multi-Tenant Security
- **Row Level Security**: Every query filtered by `church_id`
- **Data Isolation**: Zero data leakage between churches guaranteed
- **Audit Trails**: Complete logging of all profile access and modifications
